- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @RecoveringGabe
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in helping programers in their beta stages of their appliciations by having a user end experience and reporting any bugs and suggestions I find. I am a recovering
addict from substance abuse with over 3 years of sobriety. I am looking for any extra income I can find. I am a user of an Android device and a Windows computer. If you need someone 
to give yourf webside or application a try, please contact me!
